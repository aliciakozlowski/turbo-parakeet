            <p>As an intern on the Dell Alienware/XPS teams, I was tasked with creating a project that would explore innovative futures in a field tangentially related to Dell. The scope, timeline, and deliverables were all determined by myself with the help of mentorship from the Alienware team.<br><br>The final presentation was given to upper-management of Dell Design as well as follow up presentations with coworkers from the design department and individuals from the Alienware marketing team. </p>
